A simple website created using basic HTML and CSS that mimics the user interface of salesforce.com.

The website is a replica of the user interface (UI) of salesforce.com, which is a popular customer relationship management (CRM) platform. By "clone," it means that the website visually resembles salesforce.com, showcasing similar layout, design elements, and styling, but does not necessarily include the same functionality or features.
